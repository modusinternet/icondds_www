									<h3>Dr. Sheldon Lu</h3>
									<p>Greetings and welcome! My dental career started with me being a military dentist for 8 years. During my time with the US Army, I served with our troops in South Korea and had several tours throughout continental USA. While I was serving with 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, I was promoted to the rank of Major.</p>
									<p>In Fort Gordon, Georgia, I attended and completed the Army’s 3-year, post-graduate residency training. During this time, I enrolled in another academic program and earned a Master of Science degree in Oral Biology from Augusta University in 2012. As a board-certified specialist in Periodontology and Implant Surgery, I am also a Diplomate of the American Academy of Periodontology.</p>
									<p>Moving to California was sort of a silent agreement between me and my wife. We met during dental school while we were both attending University of Pittsburgh. The deal was that after we get married, she would follow me around while I wore the uniform, but afterwards we move back to the West Coast, preferably Southern California, where she’s from. Truth be told, the nice weather and the beaches are good enough reasons for me to be a transplant to the Golden State.</p>
									<p>I have been with ICONIC Dentistry since before the name change. We have a great team now and I hope that you can give us a chance to be your team of dental experts!</p>

									<h3>Dr. Matt Phan</h3>
									<p>If you ask me what made me become a dentist, I would have to say that I've always wanted to be a dentist, ever since I thought about what to do when I grow up. I guess it's sort of a family tradition. I have a several relatives who are dentists, and I think I just decided early on that I wanted to follow in their footsteps.</p>
									<p>After graduating from Tufts University in 1998, I worked for a couple of years at different offices while sampling the many aspects of dentistry, trying to figure out what I really liked to do. As it turned out, I really liked all of it, especially the challenging aspects of dentistry. To this day, having something new and challenging all the time, but also possessing the experience and ability to tackle them and help patients with dental problem is what drives me and look forward to doing dentistry day after day.</p>
									<p>In the same spirit, as a guy who loves the outdoors, I also embrace many challenges when I'm not playing dentist. Several times a year I train for different marathons and triathlons. Next year my friends and I are going to the Boston Marathon. We're also big on skiing, so Utah becomes a popular destination in the winter times.</p>
									<p>Looking forward to meeting you in our office!</p>

									<h3>Dr. Bob Yu</h3>
									<p>I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and graduated from the University of Louisville School of Dentistry. Afterwards, I completed a one-year general practice residency at Summa Akron City Hospital (where LeBron James and Steph Curry were born) to expand my clinical skills and knowledge. I am well-trained in all facets of general dentistry and am dedicated to providing the highest quality care I can to each patient.</p>
									<p>My goal is to make sure every patient feels comfortable during their treatment and leaves completely satisfied with their care. To this end, I will always choose to take the necessary time it takes. Knowing that this is my chosen profession and that it’s a life-long commitment—the longer I practice the art and science of dentistry the better I should become, I take every chance I have to further my continuing education in different aspects of dentistry.</p>
									<p>In my spare time, I enjoy exploring Southern California with my wife, playing basketball, and snowboarding. Thanks for visiting our website! Hope to see you for an appointment soon here at ICONIC Dentistry!</p>
