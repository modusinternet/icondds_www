					<p>At ICONIC Dentistry, we respect our clients' rights and we have a long-standing policy of protecting their privacy in all of our business operations.<sup>1</sup> Here are the international privacy policies to which we adhere:</p>
					<h2>The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>
					<p><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/making_your_privacy_practices_public.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CalOPPA</a> is the first state law in the United States to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
					<h3>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h3>
					<p>Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our homepage or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
					<p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>On our Privacy Policy Page.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>By emailing us.</li>
						<li>By calling us.</li>
						<li>By logging in to their account.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="contentType2">
				<div>
					<h2>Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of the US Federal Trade Commission</h2>
					<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">COPPA</a> puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the United States consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
					<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
					<h2>The CAN SPAM Act of the US Federal Trade Commission</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CAN-SPAM Act</a> is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
					<h3>We collect your email address in order to:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>NOT use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
						<li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
						<li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
						<li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
						<li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
						<li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>

					<h2>The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) of Canadian</h2>
					<p>We've adopted the CSA (Canadian Standards Association) Model Code as the basis for our own ICONIC Dentistry Privacy Code. It sets out the principles that govern the collection, use and disclosure of our clients' personal information.<sup>2</sup></p>
					<p>The CSA Model Code also forms the basis for the federal government's privacy legislation, the <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a>, which came into effect on January 1, 2001. We've updated our Privacy Code to ensure that we are in full compliance with this new legislation. The result is that we've strengthened our commitment to protect our students' personal information.</p>
					<p>We've added this text to inform you about our privacy practices. We want you to understand the purposes for which we collect personal information about our students. And we want to be sure that we have your consent to continue to collect, use and disclose your personal information for those purposes.</p>
					<h2>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of European Union Member States</h2>
					<p>Passed by the European lawmakers to create a harmonized data privacy law across all the EU member states, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GDPR</a> went into effect on May 25, 2018. Because visitors to our website and users of our services may be members of the EU, we comply with GDPR requirements in the following ways beyond the measures already taken:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Support privacy as a fundamental human right;</li>
						<li>Are accountable for managing that data appropriately; and</li>
						<li>Give individuals rights over how their personal data is processed or otherwise used.</li>
